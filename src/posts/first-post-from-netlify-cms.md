## Secondary Heading

This is the first post from the Netlify CMS GUI.  Unfortunately, the Gatsby plugin for Netlify CMS doesn't work with Netlify CMS v2 yet.  This will set the framework for working in Netlify CMS v2 once gatsby gets up to speed.  I will create a separate branch for Netlify and for the time being use Contentful.
